# Information Retrieval System
The purpose of this project done as part of carriculm project to demonstrate comprehensive understanding and practical application of various concepts and techniques related to information retrieval.

## Objective 
Objective is to building an efficient and accurate information retrieval system using different indexing and ranking methods. I explored and implement popular ranking models such as the Vector Space Model (VSM), BM25, and the Language Model with Dirichlet Smoothing. Additionally, will preprocess data, construct an inverted index, and use TREC evaluation metrics to quantitatively evaluate and compare the performance of the ranking models.
