The purpose of this project done as part of carriculm project to demonstrate comprehensive understanding and practical application of various concepts and techniques related to information retrieval.

## Objective 
Objective is to building an efficient and accurate information retrieval system using different indexing and ranking methods. I explored and implement popular ranking models such as the Vector Space Model (VSM), BM25, and the Language Model with Dirichlet Smoothing. Additionally, will preprocess data, construct an inverted index, and use TREC evaluation metrics to quantitatively evaluate and compare the performance of the ranking models.

## Important Process 
- `Collect and preprocess data`: Obtain a diverse document corpus (cran.all.1400.xml) and queries(cran.qry.xml), and apply necessary preprocessing techniques like tokenization, stemming, and stop word removal.

- `Build an inverted index`: Construct an efficient data structure to map terms to the documents that contain them, enabling faster retrieval during query processing.

- `Implement ranking models`: Understand the concepts behind the *Vector Space Model, BM25, and the Language Model with Dirichlet Smoothing*, and successfully implement them to rank documents based on their relevance to queries(cran.qry.xml).

- `Evaluate information retrieval system`: Use TREC evaluation metrics like *MAP, P@5, and NDCG@5* to quantitatively assess the performance of the ranking models and make informed decisions about their effectiveness.

- `Analyze and discuss results`: Interpret the evaluation results and provide insightful discussions on the strengths and weaknesses of each model, identifying the most suitable approach for different retrieval scenarios.

This assignment not only demonstrates knowledge of information retrieval techniques but also showcases practical skills in designing and evaluating an information retrieval system. It serves as a valuable opportunity to apply the knowledge gained from the modules and gain practical experience in the field of information retrieval.
